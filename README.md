### **5. How to Submit**

- **Push your `.sql` file to GitHub**:
  - Create a new GitHub repository.
  - Push your `library_management.sql` and the `README.md` file to the repository.
  
- **Link the ERD**:
  - If you donâ€™t have a tool for generating an ERD, you can use free tools like [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) or [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to generate and share the ERD image or link.
